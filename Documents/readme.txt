Known Issues
============
- If you have a scheduled TV recording while playing/recording a game, the
  scheduled TV recording will begin and the recorded channel will appear in the
  IHT preview window. To continue playing/recording your game, please click the
  Return to Main Window button and click the GameBridge button.

- InterVideo Home Theater (IHT) supports play back of multiple recorded clips in
  Video Clips mode. You can make multiple selections by clicking on the check
  box next to each video clips. To add more video clips for play back while IHT
  is playing back checked clips, you must first stop the playback by clicking 
  the stop button, add the video clips and then press play button again.

- When the Adaptec GameBridge™ TV is connected to the system via a USB2.0 Hub,
  and the USB2.0 Hub is hot-removed and re-connected from the system, you may
  experience no video or audio while previewing video in IHT software. To
  resolve this issue, please hot unplug and then re-connect the Adaptec
  GameBridge™ TV to the USB2.0 Hub.

- On some systems when recovering from standby mode, an error message may
  appear. Close the error message and the InterVideo Home Theatre software,
  then re-launch the InterVideo Home Theatre software to continue.

- Under Japanese Windows XP you might not be able to adjust the Brightness
  settings in the IHT Configuration Utility. Instead select the Brightness
  settings bar with the mouse and use the keyboard buttons (Left, Right, Up or 
  Down) to adjust.
  
- If the spacebar is pressed while video is playing, the video may appear to
  jerk. To resolve the jerkiness issue, please close and restart IHT software.
  
- On some systems when pressing the FastForward button rapidly the IHT software
  might appear to stall. The IHT software is actually buffering all your
  commands or mouse clicks and eventually will carry out these actions. However 
  if you really want to stop them all, you may try to end the IHTprogram by 
  using the Windows Task Manager.
